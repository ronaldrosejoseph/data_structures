'''
Array is created in Python by importing array module to the python program. Then the array is declared as shown eblow.

arrayName = array(typecode, [Initializers])

Typecode are the codes that are used to define the type of value the array will hold. Some common typecodes used are:

Typecode	Value
b	Represents signed integer of size 1 byte/td>
B	Represents unsigned integer of size 1 byte
c	Represents character of size 1 byte
i	Represents signed integer of size 2 bytes
I	Represents unsigned integer of size 2 bytes
f	Represents floating point of size 4 bytes
d	Represents floating point of size 8 bytes
